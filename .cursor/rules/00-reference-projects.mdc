## Business Logic and System Design Reference

When you are unsure about how to implement business logic or system design patterns, you can reference the following production-grade project:

### Heavenly Secrets Academy (天机学堂)

**Repository**: https://github.com/Kiraaaaaaa/Heavenly-Secrets-Academy

**Description**: A production-level online education platform based on microservices architecture, targeting adult vocational skills training (non-academic education).

**Why Reference This Project**:
- High business completeness and authenticity, very close to real enterprise projects
- Comprehensive implementation of core business scenarios:
  - Learning assistance system
  - Examination system
  - E-commerce promotion and coupon system
  - Order and payment system
  - User management system

**Key Technical Solutions to Reference**:
- Distributed lock implementation (custom annotations + Redisson)
- High-concurrency inventory deduction (Lua scripts)
- Coupon system with high-performance validation
- Order and payment processing
- Learning progress tracking
- Comment and like systems
- Sign-in and points ranking systems

**When to Reference**:
- When designing business logic for similar features (orders, promotions, users)
- When implementing high-concurrency solutions
- When designing data models and database schemas
- When implementing distributed transaction patterns
- When designing caching strategies
- When implementing message queue patterns

**Note**:
- This is a Java/Spring Cloud project, but the business logic patterns and system design principles are applicable
- Adapt the patterns to Go/go-zero framework conventions
- Focus on understanding the business logic and architecture patterns, not copying code directly
