# Aether-Defense-System Coding Standards - Overview

## Project Overview
This is a high-concurrency microservices system built with Go-Zero framework, handling trading, promotion, and user services. The system must support 40,000 QPS peak traffic with P99 latency < 100ms and 99.99% availability.

## Technology Stack
- Framework: Go-Zero (microservices framework)
- Language: Go 1.21+
- Communication: gRPC for inter-service communication
- Storage: MySQL (with sharding), Redis (caching and atomic operations)
- Message Queue: RocketMQ (transactional messages)
- Service Discovery: Etcd

## Critical Rules Summary

1. **ALWAYS create new branch** before making changes
2. **ALWAYS follow TDD** - Write tests first
3. **ALWAYS run all tests** before committing
4. **ALWAYS update documentation** with code changes
5. **ALWAYS create PR** for code review
6. **NEVER commit directly to main/master**
7. **NEVER skip tests**
8. **NEVER skip documentation**

## Reference Projects

- See `00-reference-projects.mdc` for:
  - Reference projects for business logic and system design patterns
  - When to reference external projects for implementation guidance
  - How to adapt patterns from reference projects to our Go/go-zero architecture

## AI Assistant Rules and Tools

- See `00-ai-tools-and-workflow.mdc` for:
  - What local tools/commands the AI may run (`go test`, `golangci-lint`, `pre-commit`, coverage commands, etc.)
  - How the AI must follow the same development and git workflows as humans
  - How the AI may use GitHub MCP (read-only PR/CI/issue access) within this project

## Production Deployment Rules

- See `13-production-deployment-isolation.mdc` for environment isolation (namespaces, network policies, RBAC)
- See `14-production-deployment-security.mdc` for resource limits and security (ResourceQuota, SecurityContext, secrets)
- See `15-production-deployment-ha.mdc` for disaster recovery and high availability (PDB, multi-replica, health checks)
- See `16-production-deployment-testing.mdc` for Helm chart testing strategies
- See `17-production-deployment-canary.mdc` for canary deployment and rollout strategies
- See `18-production-deployment-checklist.mdc` for deployment checklist, monitoring, and quick reference
